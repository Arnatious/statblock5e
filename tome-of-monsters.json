When a creature that can see the fear smith's eye starts its turn within 30 feet of the fear smith, the creature must make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become disoriented. While disoriented, the creature falls prone each time it tries to move or take the Dash or Disengage action. To recover from disorientation, a creature must start its turn outside the fear smith's gaze and make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.<br /> To use this ability, the fear smith can't be incapacitated and must see the affected creature. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes at the start of its turn to avoid the effect. In that case, no saving throw is necessary but the creature treats the fear smith as invisible until the start of the creature's next turn. If during its turn the creature chooses to look at the fear smith, it must immediately make the saving throw.",
